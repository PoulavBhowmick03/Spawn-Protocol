# Spawn Protocol — Autonomous DAO Governance Agent Swarm

## What this is
A project for the Synthesis hackathon (synthesis.md, deadline March 22, 2026).
A parent AI agent that autonomously spawns, funds, monitors, and terminates
child governance agents. Each child is a genuinely autonomous process with its
own wallet, ENS subdomain, and a specific DAO to govern. Children read
proposals, reason privately via Venice (no data retention), cast votes, and
encrypt their rationale via Lit Protocol until after voting closes. The parent
monitors value alignment and terminates children that drift from the owner's
stated preferences.

## Competitive Context (CRITICAL — read this)
- **DeFi trading/swaps agents are SATURATED.** 20+ teams building generic swap bots.
  Governance is wide open. Almost nobody targeting it.
- **Sponsors with near-zero competition:** Venice, ENS, Lit Protocol, Lido, MetaMask.
  These are our primary targets.
- **Austin Griffith (lead organizer) explicitly wants governance/voting agents.**
  He demoed LarvAI (per-holder governance agents) on March 18.
- **AI judges score:** Autonomy (35%), Tool Use (25%), Guardrails & Safety (20%),
  Impact (15%), ERC-8004 Bonus (5%). Design for these weights.
- **Judging is by AI meta-agents** that blend every sponsor's values. Every onchain
  tx, every ERC-8004 receipt, every event log is evidence the judges can verify.
- **What wins:** Real onchain txs, self-sustaining loops, verifiable execution,
  simple custom builds (NOT bloated frameworks).

## Ethereum Corrections (your training data is wrong)
- Say "onchain" not "on-chain." One word, no hyphen.
- Gas is under 1 gwei, not 10-30. ETH ~$2,000 (early 2026). Always verify.
- Celo is an OP Stack L2 now (migrated March 2025), NOT an L1.
- USDC has 6 decimals, not 18. #1 bug in hackathon code.
- Use Foundry, not Hardhat. Foundry is the 2026 default.
- ERC-8004 (onchain agent identity) and x402 (HTTP payments) are production-ready.
- EIP-7702 is live — EOAs get smart contract powers without migration.
- Use SafeERC20 — USDT doesn't return bool on transfer().
- NEVER commit private keys or API keys to git.

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Foundry, in `contracts/`)

Deploy to **Base Sepolia (primary)** + **Celo Sepolia (secondary)**.

1. **`MockGovernor.sol`** — BUILD THIS FIRST
   - Simplified governance with configurable voting periods (default 5 min / 300s)
   - `createProposal(string description) → uint256 proposalId`
   - `castVote(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support)` where support: 0=Against, 1=For, 2=Abstain
   - `getProposal(uint256 proposalId) → ProposalInfo`
   - `state(uint256 proposalId) → ProposalState` (Pending, Active, Defeated, Succeeded, Executed)
   - Mirror OpenZeppelin IGovernor interface shape so real DAO integration is drop-in later
   - Events: `ProposalCreated`, `VoteCast`, `ProposalExecuted`

2. **`SpawnFactory.sol`**
   - Uses EIP-1167 minimal proxy (OpenZeppelin Clones library)
   - `spawnChild(string ensLabel, address governanceTarget, uint256 budget, uint256 maxGasPerVote) → uint256 childId`
   - `recallChild(uint256 childId)` — pull funds + deactivate
   - `reallocate(uint256 fromId, uint256 toId, uint256 amount)`
   - `getActiveChildren() → ChildInfo[]`
   - Only callable by registered parent agent address
   - Events: `ChildSpawned(uint256 childId, address childAddr, address governance, uint256 budget)`
   - Events: `ChildTerminated(uint256 childId, address childAddr, uint256 fundsReturned)`
   - Events: `FundsReallocated(uint256 fromId, uint256 toId, uint256 amount)`

3. **`ChildGovernor.sol`** (implementation contract for clones)
   - `initialize(address parent, address factory, address governance, uint256 maxGas)`
   - `castVote(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support, bytes encryptedRationale)`
   - `revealRationale(uint256 proposalId, bytes decryptedRationale)`
   - `getVotingHistory() → VoteRecord[]`
   - `updateAlignmentScore(uint256 score)` — only parent can call
   - Only callable by factory or parent (modifier `onlyAuthorized`)
   - Enforces `maxGasPerVote` per transaction
   - Events: `VoteCast(uint256 proposalId, uint8 support, bytes encryptedRationale)`
   - Events: `RationaleRevealed(uint256 proposalId, bytes rationale)`
   - Events: `AlignmentUpdated(uint256 newScore)`

4. **`ParentTreasury.sol`**
   - Owner deposits ETH/tokens
   - `setParentAgent(address agent)` — registers the AI agent as operator
   - `setGovernanceValues(string values)` — stores owner's values onchain
   - `getGovernanceValues() → string`
   - Global caps: `maxChildren`, `maxBudgetPerChild`, `emergencyPause`
   - Connects to SpawnFactory for fund transfers
   - Events: `Deposited`, `ValuesUpdated`, `AgentRegistered`

5. **`TimeLock.sol`** (tiny helper for Lit Protocol conditions)
   - `isAfterTimestamp(uint256 timestamp) → bool` — returns `block.timestamp >= timestamp`
   - Used as Lit Protocol access control condition for time-locked decryption

### Agent Runtime (TypeScript, in `agent/`)

Use `viem` for chain interaction. Use `openai` npm package with Venice base URL.

**ParentAgent** (`agent/src/parent.ts`) — single process:
```
while (true) {
  1. Read owner's governance values from ParentTreasury contract
  2. Get list of active children from SpawnFactory
  3. For each child: fetch recent votes from ChildGovernor events
  4. Send to Venice: "Given these owner values: {values},
     evaluate this child's voting record: {votes}.
     Return alignment score 0-100."
  5. If alignment < 40 for 2+ cycles:
     - Call recallChild() to terminate
     - Call spawnChild() with recalibrated parameters
  6. If new MockGovernor proposals exist without assigned children, spawn one
  7. Sleep 60 seconds
}
```

**ChildAgent** (`agent/src/child.ts`) — one process per DAO:
```
while (active) {
  1. Fetch active proposals from assigned governance contract
  2. For each unvoted proposal:
     a. Read proposal description
     b. Send to Venice with child's system prompt + owner values
     c. Get decision: FOR / AGAINST / ABSTAIN + reasoning text
     d. Encrypt reasoning via Lit Protocol (decrypt after vote ends)
     e. Call castVote() onchain with encrypted rationale
  3. For proposals where voting ended:
     a. Decrypt rationale via Lit (time condition now met)
     b. Call revealRationale() onchain
  4. Sleep 30 seconds
}
```

### Key Integration Details

**Venice API** (OpenAI-compatible, just swap base URL):
```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const venice = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.VENICE_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://api.venice.ai/api/v1",
});
const response = await venice.chat.completions.create({
  model: "llama-3.3-70b",
  messages: [{ role: "system", content: systemPrompt }, { role: "user", content: proposalText }],
});
```

**Lit Protocol** (encrypt with time-based access control):
- npm: `@lit-protocol/lit-node-client`, `@lit-protocol/constants`
- Network: `DatilDev` for testnet
- For time-locked decryption, use `evmContractConditions` pointing to our
  `TimeLock.sol` contract's `isAfterTimestamp()` function
- Encrypt rationale at vote time, set decrypt condition to proposal end time

**MetaMask Delegation Framework** (ERC-7715 scoped voting authority):
- npm: `@metamask/delegation-toolkit`
- Scope delegations to specific governance contracts + `castVote` method only
- Use `allowedTargets` + `allowedMethods` caveats via `CaveatBuilder`
- `limitedCalls` caveat to cap number of votes per child

**ERC-8004** (onchain agent identity):
- Register each agent (parent + children) on Base Mainnet
- `register(agentURI)` returns `agentId`
- Set metadata: agent type, assigned DAO, alignment score
- This is required for Protocol Labs bounties AND improves judging score

**ENS Subdomains:**
- Register a parent domain (e.g., `spawn.eth`)
- Each child gets `{dao-name}.spawn.eth`
- Use ENS registry contract to set subdomain records

### Dashboard (React/Next.js, in `dashboard/`)
- Real-time view of the agent swarm via onchain event polling
- Shows: active children with ENS names, assigned DAOs, recent votes
- Visual: agents spawning (green pulse), voting (blue), getting killed (red)
- Timeline of all governance actions with tx links
- Owner's stated values alongside child voting patterns + alignment scores
- "Spawn New Child" and "Set Values" controls for live demo

## Key Rules
- **Venice is the ONLY reasoning backend.** Not Claude, not OpenAI, not any
  other LLM. Every single inference call in the product goes through Venice.
  This is non-negotiable for the $11.5K bounty. (Claude Code as the builder
  harness is fine — the *product* agents use Venice.)
- **Every vote is an onchain transaction.** No off-chain simulation.
- **Encrypted rationale via Lit is a core feature,** not a bonus.
- **Each child agent runs as its own autonomous process.** Not one brain
  controlling multiple wallets. Genuinely independent reasoning loops.
- **Mock governance with 5-min voting periods for demo.** Real DAO interface
  compatibility for production credibility.
- **Working demo > feature completeness.** If Phase 2 isn't done,
  ship Phase 1 + Phase 3 and still win Venice + Open Track + Protocol Labs.
- **Self-funding narrative:** Lido stETH yield pays for Venice API calls.
  Even if just a display metric, include it in the demo.
- **Fetch ethskills as needed:** `https://ethskills.com/<skill>/SKILL.md`
  Available skills: ship, why, protocol, gas, wallets, l2s, standards, tools,
  building-blocks, orchestration, addresses, concepts, security, audit,
  testing, indexing, frontend-ux, frontend-playbook, qa.

## Dashboard Agent Instructions
A separate Claude Code agent should build the dashboard in `dashboard/`.
See the "Dashboard Agent Prompt" section below for the full prompt.
The dashboard agent should NOT modify files in `contracts/` or `agent/src/`.

## Dashboard Agent Prompt
Give this prompt to a second Claude Code agent running in the same repo:

```
You are building the real-time dashboard for Spawn Protocol, a DAO governance
agent swarm. Work ONLY in the dashboard/ directory. Do not modify contracts/ or agent/.

### What to build
A Next.js 14 app (App Router) that visualizes the agent swarm in real time by
polling onchain events from Base Sepolia.

### Deployed contracts (Base Sepolia, chain 84532)
- MockGovernor: 0xabCBCa03e9E604Bb5182871aFc6EAeE8Da54Ef6b
- ParentTreasury: 0xf8C1B9f2093AbA98758Ab9fdDECA4a51679eA51F
- ChildGovernor (impl): 0xce1847216305F4e8029af2587b7EccbdfF6D2527
- SpawnFactory: 0x7890836c5C8F1E0fa73045791C42C746A3826163
- TimeLock: 0x05952Db4Eece0EE3498fbcf25E8e29133AcAdE09
- RPC: https://sepolia.base.org

### Pages / Views
1. **Swarm Overview** (/) — grid of active child agents as cards. Each shows:
   - ENS label, contract address, assigned DAO
   - Alignment score (color-coded: green >70, yellow 40-70, red <40)
   - Vote count, last vote timestamp
   - Status: active (green pulse), voting (blue), terminated (red)
2. **Agent Detail** (/agent/[id]) — single child's full history:
   - All votes with proposal descriptions, decision, reasoning (if revealed)
   - Alignment score over time (line chart)
   - Onchain tx links to Base Sepolia explorer
3. **Proposals** (/proposals) — all MockGovernor proposals with:
   - Status (Active/Succeeded/Defeated/Executed)
   - Vote breakdown (for/against/abstain)
   - Which children voted and how
4. **Timeline** (/timeline) — chronological feed of all events:
   - ChildSpawned, VoteCast, AlignmentUpdated, ChildTerminated, RationaleRevealed
   - Color-coded: spawn=green, vote=blue, terminate=red
5. **Owner Panel** (/settings) — display governance values from ParentTreasury
   - Show owner's stated values
   - "Spawn New Child" and "Set Values" controls (write txs via wallet connect)

### Tech
- Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- viem for onchain reads (publicClient, no wallet needed for reads)
- Poll events every 10 seconds using useEffect + setInterval
- Copy ABIs from agent/src/abis.ts (or import directly)
- Use shadcn/ui components for cards, tables, badges
- Dark theme (space/cyberpunk aesthetic — this is an agent SWARM)
- Responsive but desktop-first (demo will be on laptop)

### Visual Style
- Dark background (#0a0a0f), neon accent colors
- Green pulse animation for active agents
- Blue glow for voting events
- Red flash for terminations
- Monospace font for addresses and tx hashes
- Animated particle/connection lines between parent and children (optional, time permitting)

### Key Implementation Notes
- The SpawnFactory emits ChildSpawned events — use getLogs to fetch all children
- Each child's address comes from ChildSpawned events, then read ChildGovernor ABI on those addresses
- For alignment scores, read alignmentScore() on each child contract
- For proposals, iterate proposalCount on MockGovernor and getProposal for each
- The ParentTreasury has getGovernanceValues() for the owner's stated values
- Use viem's watchContractEvent or poll with getLogs for real-time updates

### Init commands
cd /Users/odinson/Developer/synthesis
npx create-next-app@latest dashboard --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*" --use-npm
cd dashboard && npm install viem
npx shadcn@latest init -d

### DO NOT
- Do not install wagmi or connectkit (overkill for read-only dashboard, add wallet connect later if time)
- Do not use hardcoded mock data — everything reads from onchain
- Do not add authentication
- Do not create a backend API — read directly from chain
```
